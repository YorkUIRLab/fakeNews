2747	“Do you know what the area code for Buffalo is?” begins a popular joke of the 1990s.  “Oh-for-four” (044) is the punchline response, a reference to the city’s NFL football team, which went down to defeat in four consecutive Super Bowls from 1991 to 1994.  The joke is sardonically funny, but it’s also an unfortunate reinforcement of the stigmatization of those who come up just short of first place in the highest levels of athletic competition as “failures.”  Sure, the Buffalo Bills have never won on Super Sunday and thereby established themselves as champions of the NFL, but that shortfall should not be allowed to obscure the Bills’ remarkable achievement: only an extraordinarily talented team could have reached the Super Bowl for four straight years, and nobody but the Bills has ever accomplished that feat.

No single image sums up that reputation more succinctly than the claim that fans in Philadelphia once booed and pelted with snowballs that most inoffensive, beloved, and benevolent of figures, Santa Claus himself.

2779	Want to know if the bulls or bears will be rampaging through the market this year? Popular wisdom says look to the Super Bowl for the answer because a seemingly startling correlation appears to exist between who wins the big game and how the market will perform in that calendar year. According to the “Super Bowl Indicator,” a triumphant team from the old American Football League (now the American Football Conference, or AFC) foreshadows a down market, but a winner from the old NFL (now the National Football Conference, or NFC) means dust off your red cape, because the bulls are coming.	false

We know to erect a Christmas tree, for instance, but we don’t know why we’re supposed to, other than it looks good in our living room and gives us a place to leave presents under. We know we’re supposed to kiss under mistletoe, but we don’t know why, and we harbor a vague sense of wanting to give something to carolers who come to our door, but offhand can’t think of any reason to other than ordinary hospitality.	false
